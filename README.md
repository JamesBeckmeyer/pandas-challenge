In this week's project, we looked at data from a number of district and charter schools within a city. These schools had a wide range of student populations, budgets, and passing rates within reading and math. We attempted to see if there was a correlation between spending, school type, and size to see if there was a correlation in which schools had higher overall passing rates.

The overall school budget does not appear to make a dramatic impact on passing rates for students. In fact, the overall passing rate declines in each spending bracket we reviewed. There appears to be two more relevant factors in passing rates.

School size appears to play a significant factor in the passing rates of students. Although small and medium schools perform similarly, larger schools (over 2000 total students) perform ~30% worse. I would suggest collecting data from these schools on the ratio of students to teachers. I imagine that classroom size may have a direct correlation with passing rates, and I believe that this jump that we show is a byproduct of that.

The school type also made a dramatic difference on passing rates. Charter schools outperform district schools by close to 40%. I believe this also ultimately explains why lower spending per student seems to outperform higher spending. Our lowest bracket of spending ranges (<$585 per student) was exclusively populated by charter schools, while our highest spending was exclusively populated by district schools.
